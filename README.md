# Smartphone-Controlled-Robot-4WS-4WD--ESP32
Final Semester Project for Unitec Institue of Technology.

These are codes and 3D modellings I have created for my final semester project at Unitec Institute of Technology.

I have created an Android App using MIT App Inventor and custom PCB board which includes ESP32 micro-controller which will use its Bluetooth feature for the connection.

The Prototype Robot has 4DC motors and 4 Servo motors to meet the mobility objective. The Android App has various steering modes for the servos to move to its desired positions.

Please read the Report for more detailed analysis of this project.

Thank you
